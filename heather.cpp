//                      - Added /n command to disable plot/adev updates (useful if reading
//                        in a log file and you don't want incoming data to update
//                        the screen).  Also 'u' key toggles update mode.
//                      - Changed survey command to /ss=# (to reduce chances of

//
//
// rev 2.00 - 26 Mar 09 - Lots of major and minor changes....
//                      - Split code into three files: a header include file,
//                        main code,  gps controller specific (mostly) code
//                      - Cleaned up comments, etc.
//                      - Added version info to Windows title bar.
//                      - The DOS version now operates in 16 color mode
//                        (previously it was in 256 color mode)
//                      - All queue accesses now go through function calls that
//                        get or put a queue entry.  This allows EMS memory support.
//                      - The DOS version supports using EMS memory for the 
//                        plot queue (16 meg allows over 8 days of data at 
//                        1 second intervals).  If EMS memory is used for the 
//                        plot queue, enough DOS memory is available to
//                        handle around 56,000 adev queue entries.  
//                      - Default adev queue size is now 33,000 entries.  This 
//                        allows HDEVs, MDEVs and TDEVs to tau=10000.  If DOS
//                        mode and no EMS memory seen, it is still 22,000 entries.
//                      - Added mouse support to DOS version
//                      - Left clicking on a column in the graphs will enter
//                        scroll mode and zoom the plot in or out.  The selected 
//                        column will be centered in the plot window (if possible).
//                      - Added auto scaling of graphs.   Individual graphs can 
//                        be controlled from the keybord.  Auto scaled graphs
//                        show the scale factor preceeded by a '~'.  Fixed
//                        scale factors are preceeded by an '='.
//                      - All graphs can now have a floating center line
//                        reference value or the user can set a fixed value.
//                        Floating reference values are shown preceeded by
//                        a '~'.   Fixed refernce values are preceeded by an '='.
//                      - Added support for downsampling the plot queue data to
//                        the plot window.  This allows switching from a short
//                        term view of the data (seconds) to a long term (daily)
//                        view.  Keyboard commands 'v', 'x',  and 'y'
//                        control the view.  V=user set view interval,
//                        X=1 hr/div   Y=1 day/screen (also divides the plot
//                        into 24 divisions)  
//                      - Note that if downscaling is in use that the 
//                        display of time skip markers, etc is not accurate.
//                        Markers or other events that do not happen on a
//                        displayed sample will not be visible because all
//                        non-displayed samples are skipped over.
//                      - Added ability to process strings/parameters for
//                        keyboard commands.
//                      - Queue update interval can be set from the keyboard
//                      - Queue contents can be written to a log file
//                        (the normal log command writes the log as the
//                        data comes in).  Note that the *tow* field in logs
//                        generated from queue data is not the official GPS
//                        time-of-week,  but just a sequential number.
//                      - Log files can be read in from the keyboard or 
//                        command line.  
//                      - Changed Windows mode default plot queue size to 7 days.
//                        (or 30 days with /q).  Default size for DOS version
//                        with EMS memory is 3 days.  One day of data takes
//                        around 2 meg of memory.
//                      - Added support for calculating ADEVS, HDEVS, MDEVS,
//                        and TDEVS.  (MDEVs and TDEVs can also be calculated
//                        with non-overlapping data which is not usually done
//                        for those measurements and gives somewhat bogus data).
//                      - Several keyboard and command line option select
//                        characters have changed.  Review the keybord help
//                        screen and the "heather /?" screen for details.
//                      - The meanings of the plot scrolling characters have
//                        changed (hopefully for the better).  
//                        UP arrow and PageUP means move the start of the
//                        plot forward in time.  DOWN arrow and PageDN, says
//                        to move back in time.
//                        For left arrow and '<' or right arrow and '>'
//                        the meaning is to slide the plot in the direction of
//                        the arrow.
//                      - Added /g# command toggling graph enables
//                        /ga (adevs)   /gc (satellite count)
//                        /gk (constellation change tick marks - undocumented feature) 
//                        /gd (dac voltage)  /go (osc)  /gp (pps)  /gt (temperature) 
//                        /gs (time skip tick marks)  /ge (shows skips as big red lines)
//                        The old /o and /b commands no longer do this.
//                      - The old /g and /u commands for GPS and UTC time
//                        are now /tg and /tu
//                      - You can set the temperature scale to Fahrenheit with
//                        /tf,  Kelvin with /tk,  Rankine with /tr,  Delisle
//                        with /td,  Newton with /tn,  Romer with /to, and
//                        Reaumur with /te,  Celsius with /tc
//                      - You can set the altitude scale to feet with /t'
//                        or meters with /tm
//                      - The DOS version command for forcing text only mode is
//                        now /vt (was just /t)
//                      - The /0 command disables serial port (useful if reading
//                        log files on a system without a Thunderbolt, but with
//                        some other conflicting equipment on the serial port).
//                      - Added '&' keyboard command for changing oscillator
//                        control paramters.
//                      - Added ability to set DAC voltage when disabling
//                        oscillator disciplining.
//                      - Who knows what else changed...  beer was involved...
//
//
// rev 3.00 - 01 Feb 10 - Split code into 5 files (header, main, user interface,
//                        misc major functions,  GPS controller).
//                      - Note that when Heather says to "press any key" that
//                        this means normal typing keys...  some function and
//                        special purpose keys are not recognized.
//                      - Validated more TSIP message data values.
//                      - Improved Windows version operation if no Tbolt is
//                        connected.  Note that if you start the program in a
//                        windowed mode and then go to full screen mode,  you
//                        may need to press the space bar to get the screen
//                        to draw the first time.
//
//                      - Numerous screen formatting tweaks.  Oh, so many 
//                        screen formatting tweaks.  So very, very many screen 
//                        formatting tweaks.   Did I mention there were a lot
//                        of screen formatting tweaks?
//                      - Major restructuring of the plot code so that it is
//                        driven from a table of plot parameters.  This makes
//                        it fairly easy to add more plots.  The extra plots
//                        are selected by the commands G1..G9.  When extra plots
//                        are selected their zero ref/scale factor headers appear
//                        in order from most recently selected to oldest.  Only
//                        as many headers as will fit on the screen are shown
//                        (but all selected plots are drawn).  The selected 
//                        statistic of the most recently selected extra plot 
//                        is also shown.
//                      - Deleted the M (modify graph scale factor) and Z 
//                        (modify graph zero reference) keyboard commands.
//                        These functions are now accessed via the Gx command
//                        (where X is the plot that you want to modify).
//
//                      - Added Graph menu option (L) to display a linear
//                        regression trend line of the parameter.
//
//                      - Added Graph menu option (F) to calculate a FFT of the
//                        selected plot.  The data to be analyzed starts at the
//                        beginning of the plot window and when the max fft size
//                        points or the end of the plot data are reached.  The
//                        data is sampled from the plot data at the viewing
//                        interval.  The FFT data is placed in plot G4.  The max
//                        FFT size is set by the /qf[=#] command line option.
//                        (1024 points if not given,  /qf is 4096 points,
//                        otherwise it is whatever is set (must be a power of 2).
//                        Note that a FFT requires the input data to be bandwidth
//                        limited to below the sample frequency or else you will.  You should set
//                        get spurious values due to aliasing.  Set the display
//                        display filter count to at least the value shown as
//                        the "view interval" in minutes/division.
//
//                      - Tweaked formatting of the plot area so the vertical
//                        size is a multiple of VERT_MAJOR and the horizontal
//                        size is a multiple of HORIZ_MAJOR.
//                      - Text only mode no longer uses video page swapping
//                        to switch between data and help screens.  This
//                        permits the text only mode code to be usable as a
//                        graphics 640x480 mode.
//                      - 800x600 and below mode now display the help info
//                        in full screen mode.
//
//                      - Fixed '_' edit cursor in WINDOWS version
//                      - Added editing to the string input routine.  LEFT and
//                        RIGHT arrows move the cursor within the string. INSERT
//                        toggles insert mode.  HOME moves to the start of the
//                        string.  END moves the end of the string.  DEL deletes
//                        the character at the cursor.  DOWN arrow deletes to 
//                        the end of the line.  UP arrow deletes to the start
//                        of the line. BACKSPACE deletes the character before
//                        the cursor.
//                      - If a keyboard command suggests an input value and
//                        the first character that you enter is a not an  
//                        editing character,  the suggestion is erased.
//                      - You get a beep whenever a write to EEPROM is requested.
//                        If you hear lots of unexpected beeps,  something is 
//                        probably wrong and you may be wearing out the EEPROM.
//                      - Changing any of the PPS/OSC/Cable delay parameters
//                        from the keyboard now stores the values in EEPROM
//                        (segment 6).  The /C, /P, /+, /- or /^ command
//                        line options do not set the EEPROM values.
//                      - You can append an 'f' or 'm' to the cable delay value
//                        to set the delay in feet or meters of 0.66 velocity
//                        factor coaxial cable.
//                      - Command line options that toggle an option on/off may
//                        be followed by a "1" or "0" to set the flag value 
//                        directly. e.g. Use /go1 to force the osc plot on, /go0
//                        to turn it off, or use /go to toggle the osc plot flag.
//                        Note that the /gb and /gm commands are not toggleable
//                        options.  They always turn the azel map on.
//                      - Fixed bug in send_dword argument (was double, 
//                        now is u32).  This affected the self-survey command
//                        and possibly the set dac value command.
//                      - If a self survey is not in process,  the greyed out 
//                        survey display is replaced with the oscillator
//                        disciplining parameters.  
//                      - The satellite elevation mask and signal (AMU) mask
//                        values are displayed by the filter settings (if there
//                        is room on the screen).
//                      - Added ability to set the foliage mode,  PDOP, and
//                        receiver movement dynamics filters.  The PDOP 2D/3D
//                        switchover level is always set to 0.75*PDOP level
//                        value.  These filter values are set from the 'F' menu.
//                        Note that the tbolt firmware automatically disables
//                        the A)ltitude filter is A)ir movement dynamics is 
//                        selected.
//                      - Made exit program key sequence "ESC y" (was ESC ESC).
//                        Use /ke command line option to allow ESC ESC.
//                      - Made mouse disable command line option /km.
//                      - Made beep disable command line option /kb.
//                      - Defaults to not exit on com port errors.
//                      - Added /kc command line option to disable all writes
//                        to the configuration EEPROM.
//                      - Rewrote the serial port i/o routines to not use the
//                        COMBLOCK.H routines.  This greatly improved the
//                        performance and reliabilty.  Virtually eliminated
//                        corrupted messages and time skips.
//                      - Fixed mouse operation if Windows version is running
//                        in the (rather unreadable) downscaled window (when
//                        requested screen size is > physical screen size).
//                      - Mouse no longer responds when Heather is not on top.
//                        (ok, when Heather's window is not on top).
//                      - All temperature info is kept in Celsius (including
//                        values written to the log file.  It is converted
//                        to the user selected temperatue scale only when
//                        displayed (previous versions converted the temp to
//                        the user specified scale when it was read from the
//                        Tbolt)
//                      - Added #OSC_GAIN value to log files.  This allows the
//                        computation of osc drift and tempco from logged data
//                        acquired on a unit that does not have the same osc 
//                        gain (or that is not connected to a tbolt).  If the
//                        osc gain has been loaded from a log file,  it is
//                        shown in yellow.
//                      - log files written from queue data are written in
//                        write mode (not append mode).  Writing queue data to
//                        a log file while also writing live data to a log file
//                        may cause problems...  it seems to work,  but I have
//                        no idea why...
//                      - You can write filtered queue data to a log file.
//                        Use the WF command to enable/disable writing filtered
//                        data.  You also have to have the display filter set.
//                      - if writing the plot window queue data to a log file
//                        AND the plot queue is full and wraping AND the queue
//                        updates are not paused AND the plot window covers
//                        all of the queue data,  then there will be a glitch
//                        at the beginning of the log output file.  Several
//                        seconds of the latest data will appear at the start 
//                        of the log data.
//
//                      - Windows version added the ability to talk to a remote 
//                        unit over a TCP/IP link.  Use /ip=ip_addr command line
//                        option to enable TCP/IP access.  The remote unit
//                        must be connected to a machine running the SERVER.EXE
//                        program.
//                      - Added '?' keyboard command to display the command 
//                        line help dialog.
//                      - Both the TCP/IP link and help dialog features use
//                        a windows message timer to keep the program running
//                        if the help dialog box is active or the screen is
//                        being dragged, etc.   This timer has the potential to
//                        cause very intermittent, random "unhandled exception"
//                        aborts.   You can disable the timer feature with the
//                        /kt command.  Without the timer,  the program will
//                        not process TSIP messages while the help dialog is
//                        being displayed.  Also you can drop the TCP/IP 
//                        connection if the window is being dragged or is
//                        minimized.
//
//                      - Added &a keyboard command to automatically set
//                        the oscillator disciplining parameters to their
//                        "optimum" values.   Wait for the unit to stabilize
//                        with (relatively) steady DAC, OSC, and PPS values
//                        then issue the '&a' command.  Heather will tickle
//                        your oscillator and determine good values for the
//                        osc gain and initial dac voltage.  The time constant
//                        will be set to 500 seconds,  and the damping to 1.0
//                        Also the AMU (signal level) mask will be set to 1.0
//                        and the satellite elevation mask to 25 degrees.
//                        The values will be written to the configuration EEPROM.
//                        You can then manually change any of the parameters
//                        that may not suit your needs.
//                      - the & keyboard char brings up the oscillator 
//                        parameter and satellite max signal level display 
//                        screens.  To return to normal display mode
//                        do a GR command to redraw the screen or press SPACE
//                        twice to toggle the keyboard help menu on and off.
//                        Also another '&' will cancel the oscillator info mode.
//                      - Moved the OSC and PPS polarity and the PPS signal
//                        enable/disable keyboard commands to the '&' 
//                        menu (they were '^',  '+', ' -', and 'P').
//                      - Added osc drift rate and tempco values to the '&'
//                        osc parameter display.  These are calculated from the
//                        data points shown in the plot window.  
//                        For the best results,  select a plot display interval
//                        that covers a fairly long time interval with well 
//                        behaved DAC and/or TEMP values.
//                        The OSC drift rate value makes the most sense if 
//                        the temperature is stable.  The OSC tempco value 
//                        makes the most sense if the temperature 
//                        is allowed to change in a linear ramp.  This is
//                        easy to achieve with the active temperature control
//                        mechanism.
//                      - Modified the C (clear) keyboard command to allow
//                        the plot and adev queues to be cleared individually.
//                      - You can cause the adev queue to to be cleared and then
//                        reloaded from the portion of the plot queue data 
//                        currently being displayed on the screen with the CS
//                        keyboard command.
//
//                      - If you left click on a point in the plots to zoom in/out
//                        it is marked by ^ and v on the top and bottom rows.
//                        You can return to the mark with the @ or 0 keyboard command.
//                      - You can right click on the graph to mark a point
//                        and center the display on it (without zooming).  You
//                        can return to the mark with the '@' or '0' keyboard command.
//                      - You can scroll the plot by a variable amount with each
//                        right mouse click by moving the mouse to the left or
//                        right of the plot center and right clicking. The
//                        further the mouse is from the center line,  the more
//                        it is scrolled.  
//                      - If you hold the right mouse button down, the plot 
//                        continuously scrolls. The further the mouse is from 
//                        the plot center line,  the faster it is scrolled.  
//                        If the display filter is set,  works best on faster 
//                        Windows machines.
//                      - You can also set 9 other markers with the 1..9 keys.
//                        The point at the mouse cursor is marked.  You can also
//                        use the '=' key to set the next unused marker at
//                        the point.  To return to a mark,  enter the marker
//                        number (0-9).  To clear the mark,  return to it by
//                        typing its number followed by '-'.  If you accidentally
//                        go to a marker,  you can return to where you were 
//                        (but centered on the screen) if the next key that you
//                        press is '+'.  The GR screen redraw command clears 
//                        all markers. Markers are also saved/restored when you
//                        write/read a log file.
//
//                      - If the previous key was not a marker command (where
//                        a following + or - key will undo a marker)  you can
//                        use the '+' or '-' keys to move the last selected
//                        graph up or down 0.1 divisions.   That graph's scale
//                        factor and center reference values will be "fixed".
//
//                      - The plot View time is now specified in minutes/division
//                        via the keyboard V command or the /Y= command line option.
//                        You can also set the view time directly in days, hours, 
//                        minutes, or seconds by appending a d, h, m, or s to the
//                        value.  i.e.  /y=5h sets the total view time to 5
//                        hours,  while /y=5 sets view time to 5 minutes/division.
//                        The keyboard VA command will view all the data.
//                        The same method can be used with the keyboard command.
//                        Also,  the old display of the PLOTQ update interval 
//                        value is now the length of time the plot queue can hold.
//
//                      - Added Thunderbolt unit version, serial number, and 
//                        production info to the log file header.
//                      - Added support for writing log file in either append or
//                        write mode.  /W=file command now defaults to write 
//                        mode.  Use /wa=file for append mode.  
//                      - Added WD keyboard command to delete files.
//                      - Also the keyboard L (log) command has been changed.
//                        You can now specify the file to write or append, 
//                        delete the file, or set the log interval.
//
//                      - Modifed the adev code to calculate adevs incrementally
//                        as the data is collected (the older version recalulated
//                        the adev numbers from scratch every 10 seconds).  The
//                        incremental version is MUCH faster.  The incremental
//                        adev code has the ability to calculate the adevs
//                        based on all data points taken during a run,  but to
//                        keep the adev numbers fairly "fresh",  the info 
//                        accumulated since the adev queue overflowed is cleared
//                        out once the queue overflows a second time.  On slow
//                        machines you may notice a pause whenever this happens
//                        because all the adev bins must be recalculated.
//                      - Deleted support of non-overlapping adevs.  Overlapping
//                        adevs make much better use of the available data.
//                      - Modified ADEV graph scaling.  Older versions had a 
//                        fixed top decade of 1.0E-8.  This version calculates
//                        the top decade of the curves from the data.  All ADEV
//                        types use the same ADEV scale.  The top decade line
//                        is determined from the largest ADEV value seen in any
//                        of the ADEV tables.
//                      - The "all adev" commands (AP and AO) now lets you
//                        control what info to display.  All four adev plots
//                        only, all four adev types and the graphs (can be a
//                        bit confusing since the same colors are used for
//                        two different things),  or graphs and the two regular
//                        adev plots.
//                      - For 800x600 mode and below,  the ADEV plot decades 
//                        are scaled to single VERT_MAJOR divisions (not to 
//                        every two divisions)  (also the sat count plot is 
//                        scaled two sats per division)
//                      - If adev plots are disabled,  the ADEV decade lines
//                        are no longer highlighted in CYAN.
//
//                      - Added /VN /VU /VV /VX /VH /VZ command line options for other
//                        screen sizes. Note that if your video driver/monitor
//                        does not support the exact screen res,  the program
//                        may not run or will run in that horrid scaled down
//                        window. The VU command (for undersized) 640x480 screens.
//                      - Added /VC=COLSxROWS command for custom screen sizes
//                        (e.g.  /VC=1920x1200)
//                      - Added ability to specify the VESA video mode number
//                        to use for each screen resolution (like /VH=304) 
//                        in the DOS version of the program.
//                      - Added support in DOS for a small (8x8) font.  Use 
//                        a ':' after the screen res letter (/VM:  or /VH:304)
//                        on the command line.  From the keyboard,  append a 
//                        's' or a ':' after the mode number.
//                        Small fonts allow space for things like the sat info
//                        data plus the big clock.  (Plus, I get a kickback
//                        from your eye doctor).
//                      - Added ability to change screen size with the
//                        '$' keyboard command.  This command was originally
//                        intended only for debugging,  and may not work 
//                        as you might expect or desire... such is life.
//                        Changing video modes may leave options enabled that
//                        are not compatible with the new screen resolution.
//                        You can answer the command confirmation with 
//                        an N to not select the mode, or Y (for the 
//                        windowed screen) or F (for fullscreen attempt).   
//                        You can also select the font size by adding a T 
//                        (tiny 8x8) S (small 8x12)  M (medium 8x14)  or L 
//                        (large 8x16).
//                        !!! NOTE: The Windows version will crash if you start
//                        the program in non full-screen mode,  switch to 
//                        full screen with the F11 key,  then change the screen 
//                        resolution !!!  
//
//                      - Modified Windows vidstr function to draw the 
//                        degrees, up arrow, and down arrow symbols (which were
//                        not in the standard font).
//                      - Sat info shows if sat elevation is rising or falling
//                      - Added satellite azimuth/elevation plot (can be
//                        displayed in either the plot area or in place of 
//                        the adev tables - controlled by GM and GB commands).
//                        For screens 1280 pixels and wider the az/el plot 
//                        and adev tables can both be shown at the same time.
//                        For screens 1600 pixels and wider,  there is always 
//                        room for the az/el map outside of the plot area, so
//                        the GB command is not needed.  
//                      - A dot is drawn on satellite position history trails at 
//                        :00 and :30 minutes (at 22 seconds past the hour, 
//                        if you are picky about such things)  The trail marker
//                        is a solid dot in on the hour,  it is hollow at all 
//                        other times.
//                        
//                      - Flags holdover state with a red line at the top of 
//                        the plot - controlled by GH command.  Holdover is also
//                        indicated when a false temperature sensor spike is
//                        detected during active temperatue control.
//                      - Added /tj command line option to remove the filtering
//                        that the tbolt firmware does to the temperature sensor
//                        readings. (this now defaults to remove the filtering
//                        so use /tj to restore the filtering).  Removing the
//                        filtering makes false sensor reading spikes stand out
//                        better and minimizes their effect on the temperature
//                        control loop.  It does make the temperature display
//                        a little less smooth since you now see the raw sensor
//                        readings that have around 0.01C increments.
//                      - Added '%' keyboard command to move plot to the next
//                        holdover and/or time skip event.  If holdover display
//                        is turned off,  moves to next time skip.  If error
//                        display is turned off,  moves to next holdover event.
//                        If both displays are on or off,  moves to next 
//                        occurance of either.  The event is positioned where
//                        the mouse cursor is.
//                    
//                      - Added GL command to hide precise lat/lon on display.
//                        Useful if you are publishing a screen dump and those
//                        pesky voices in your head say to keep your location 
//                        private.
//                      - Added GG command to add a graph title.  Titles are 
//                        also saved to/loaded from the log file.  If a
//                        plot title contains an '&' then the '&' is replaced
//                        with the oscillator disciplining parameters.  To put
//                        the '&' in a title use &&.
//                      - Added GU command to redraw the plot on every incoming 
//                        point.  The screen is configured to scroll back by
//                        one pixel. This gives a continuously scrolling graph. 
//                        When you are in continuous scroll mode,  the center 
//                        reference line > < markers are CYAN (normally white).
//                        Continuous scroll mode makes sense to do only if you 
//                        are running the Windows version!  The DOS plot 
//                        erase/redraw is rather slow and ugly.  Also it may be
//                        a problem on slower Windows machines if the display
//                        filter is enabled.  /GU on is the default for WINDOWS.
//                      - Added command to plot menu to display a statistical
//                        value (average, rms value,  standard deviation or 
//                        variance) of the plot data.  This is the calculated
//                        from the data currently shown on the screen.
//                        The G/ command sets the statistic type for all plots
//                        or you can use use the '/' command on the plot 
//                        parameter sub-menu for the individual plots.
//                      - The GS keyboard command now toggles the sound flag
//                        (was display time skips as annoyingly large red lines)
//                      - Turning off auto scaling of graphs also turns off
//                        auto centering.
//                      - Plot scale factors can now be negative.  This allows
//                        a plot's direction to be inverted.  You can specify
//                        a scale factor of -0 (or 0-) to invert the plot with
//                        autoscaling enabled.
//                      - Added the MI command to invert the PPS and temperature
//                        plots (so their direction matches the OSC and DAC plots).
//
//                      - Added FL command for setting minimum acceptable signal
//                        level (in AMU units).  Thunderbolt default is 4,  but
//                        a value of 1.0 gives better performace since the
//                        tracked satellite constellation will not change as
//                        often.  Satellite constellation changes have a large
//                        impact on the stability of the output signals. Weak
//                        signals have a fairly small effect.
//                      - Added FE command for setting the satellite elevation
//                        mask angle (in degrees).  Satellites below the mask
//                        angle will not be tracked.  The FE and FL values are
//                        saved in EEPROM when set and do not need to be
//                        re-entered every time the program is run.
//                      - Added GJ keyboard command and /GJ command line option
//                        to disable the sat elevation mask display in the
//                        az/el plot.
//                      - Added commands to the filter menu options to change
//                        the tbolt dynamics and foliage filters
//
//                      - Added antenna survey modes to the Survey menu.  
//                        To use these you should first set the F)ilter 
//                        E)levation mask to 0 degrees.  Signal levels
//                        should be set to dBc.  If the receiver is in
//                        AMU mode the AMU values are converted to dBc 
//                        values via an emprically determined algorithm.
//                        For best results you should collect data for 24 hours.
//                        (note that the program is always collecting signal
//                         data while it is running,  not just when an antenna
//                         survey display is enabled.  You should do an SAC 
//                         command after you set the elevation mask to 0 so
//                         that old data collected at different mask values
//                         is cleared out).  
//         
//                        SAA - displays relative signal level seen at each
//                              azimuth angle
//                        SAW - displays relative signal level seen at each
//                              azimuth angle,  with the signal strength
//                              weighted inversely with elevation angle.  This
//                              highlights low elevation antenna blockages and
//                              low orbit angles that have no satellites.
//                        SAE - displays relative signal level seen at each
//                              elevation angle
//                        SAS - displays color coded map of the absolute signal 
//                              level seen at each azimuth/elevation point.
//                        SAD - shows raw satellite signal level data points
//                              (much like the GM satellite position map)
//                        SAC - clears the old signal level data and starts 
//                              collecting new data.
//
//                        You can use the Z key to zoom the signal survey 
//                        displays to full screen.  The Z command also works
//                        if the digital clock,  the analog watch,  or the
//                        satellite az/el displays are enabled.  If the display
//                        is ZOOMed then any keystroke except '\' returns the
//                        display to normal.  To dump a zoomed display to disk
//                        you must use the '\' command to write the file 
//                        "tbolt.gif"...  you cannot specify a file name.
//
//                        You can use the WZ keyboard command to write 
//                        the az/el signal level data to a file.  You should
//                        always use the .SIG file extension because you can 
//                        read in .SIG files and display the signal level data.
//
//                      - Added FD command to allow filtering (averaging) of 
//                        pps/osc/dac/temp graphs.  Note the filter is applied
//                        only when the plot is redrawn. Live incoming data 
//                        is not filtered until the plot scrolls or is 
//                        redrawn.  Be careful when using large filter values
//                        with long view time displays.  It can take a lot
//                        of time to process the data on slower machines.  
//                      - If the filter count is a negative value (including -0 
//                        or 0-) then the PPS and temperature plots are inverted.
//                        This makes all the plots track in the same direction.
//                        You can also do this with the MI keyboard command.
//                        Also,  you can append the '-' to the filter count 
//                        value.
//                      - Added /X[=#] command line option to set the display
//                        filter count... see above
//                      - If the display filter is turned on,  the values shown
//                        at the mouse cursor are the filtered values.
//
//                      - Added screen image dump to .GIF and .BMP files (this 
//                        changed the meanings of the old 'WS' keyboard command 
//                        (now is WP)).
//                        If the redrawing of the plot area after entering the file 
//                        name causes problems (like erasing the lat/lon/alt map
//                        which cannot be redrawn),  use the '\' keyboard command.
//                        This dumps the screen to TBOLT.GIF without prompting
//                        for a file name.  
//                        Note that screen dumps take quite a while on the DOS 
//                        version (around 20 secs for a 1024x768 screen on a
//                        200 MHz machine).  You get a beep at the start and 
//                        end of the dump.  The screen does not update during
//                        a dump.
//                      - WR command does a "reverse video" screen dump.  Black
//                        and white are swapped so that the screen dump is
//                        better suited to printing.  If you start to select a 
//                        reverse video screen dump (even if you do not complete
//                        it with a ESC key) the reverse video attribute will 
//                        will be used for any following '\' initiated screen 
//                        dumps.  The same applies to normal polarity screen dumps.
//
//                      - Added precise statistical position survey command (SP).
//                        This takes 48 hours to complete unless you specified
//                        a different value.  Works best with 48 hours,  well 
//                        with 24 hours,  OK with 12 hours.  After completion,
//                        the position is saved to a high precision:
//                      - Added SL keyboard command to enter lat/lon/alt. If the 
//                        position error due to using the single precision TSIP
//                        command is under 1 foot lat/lon,  1 meter altitude, 
//                        then the TSIP command is used.  Otherwise repeated 
//                        single point surveys are done until one gets close 
//                        enough to the desired location.  This usually takes 
//                        under 4 hours,  however it can go on forever...  
//                        particularly if the value you entered is not close
//                        to the actual location.  Poorer antennas take a 
//                        longer time since they spread the fixes out over a 
//                        larger area.
//                      - Interrupting a survey or precise position save will 
//                        save the current location using the lower precision 
//                        TSIP command.  So will exiting the program while a 
//                        survey is in progress.
//                      - On the command line, you can use /SP[=#] to start a 
//                        precise survey.specify.  You can specify the 
//                        number (#) of hours to do the precise survey for.
//                        Default is 48.  Other values will give inferior results.
//                        24 or 12 hours makes more sense than other values.
//                      - Added SF command to put unit into 2D/3D fix mode and
//                        plot the dispersion of the fixes around the current 
//                        location. Useful for evaluating antenna performance.
//                        Note that the fix data will be lost if the screen
//                        if the screen res is changed.  Also note that in
//                        fix modes that the unit check the PDOP of the
//                        satellite positions and will go into HOLDOVER mode
//                        if it is too large.  You should not use the fix
//                        modes as a standard operating mode!
//                      - You can put the unit into single sat mode with the 
//                        SO command (thats the letter O,  as in One)
//                      - There is also an S3 command for putting the unit
//                        into 3D only fix mode.  You can also use S0..S7 for
//                        putting the receiver into other operating modes:
//                          S0=2d/3d  S1=single sat  S2=2D mode  S3=3D mode
//                          S4=overdetermined clock  S5=DGPS reference
//                          S6=2d clock hold mode    S7=overdertmined clock
//                        Note that DGPS reference mode disables the receiver
//                        timing functions.
//                      - The SP and SF survey commands also write a LLA.LLA 
//                        lat/lon/alt log file. 
//
//                      - Added ability to read lat/lon/alt logs.  These files
//                        must have an extension of .LLA   Data lines require:
//                          time-of-week  flag  lat  lon  alt
//                          flag=0 means good reading,  otherwise skip it
//                        This format can be generated by TBOLTMON log command.
//                        Other .LLA file commands supported are:
//                           # text comments
//                           #title: Title text (note that the ': ' is required)
//                           #lla: ref_lat  ref_lon  ref_alt (your assumed exact location)
//                        The first line of an LLA file must be a '#' line.
//                      - Added ability to read adev files.  These files
//                        must have an extension of .ADV  These files can have
//                        two independent values per line (identified as PPS
//                        and OSC)  The .ADV files can also can contain:
//                           # text comments
//                           #title: title text (note that the ': ' is required)
//                           #period seconds_between_readings (default=1)
//                           #scale  scale_factor_1  scale_factor_2  
//                        The scale factor value multipled by the data values 
//                        should yield nanoseconds.
//                        Note that the #period command erases any data values
//                        that appeared before it in the file.
//                        The first line of an ADV file must be a '#' line.
//                      - Can also read .TIM files from John Miles' TI.EXE
//                        program.  The CAP/TIM/IMO, PER, and SCA commands are
//                        used.
//                      - Added ability to read script files.  These files must
//                        have an extension of .SCR  Script files mimic typing
//                        commands from the keyboard.  Script file names must
//                        be less than 128 chars long.
//                        Commands that would normally suggest an input do not 
//                        do it when read from a script file.  They behave
//                        like you first entered ESC to erase the suggestion.  
//                        Commands that normally toggle a flag may be followed 
//                        by a "1" or "0" to set the flag value directly. e.g.
//                        you can use MA0 in a script file to force auto 
//                        scaling off. The GS and GM commands do not toggle
//                        a specific value and cannot be used this way.
//                        You can put more than one command on a line (separated
//                        by spaces) until you do a command that expects a
//                        parameter value or string.  
//                        A '~' in a script file pauses reading from the script 
//                        and starts reading from the keyboard until a carriage
//                        return is seen.  Most useful for entering a parameter
//                        value or string.  e.g.  GG~ will pause the script and
//                        prompt for a graph title.
//                        Any text following a ';' or a '#' in a script file 
//                        is a comment and is ignored.
//                        Script files abort upon the first error or any 
//                        unrecognized command seen.  
//                        Script files can be nested up to 5 levels deep.
//                        Scripts can be stopped by pressing any key.
//                      - Added .CFG config file to read command line options 
//                        from.  The DOS version first looks for exe_file_name.CFG 
//                        in the current directory.  If not found, it looks for the 
//                        exe_file_name.CFG file  in the same directory as the 
//                        executable file. For WINDOWS use HEATHER /? to find 
//                        where it is looking.  The default file must be named 
//                        HEATHER.CFG.  You can also read other config
//                        files with the /H=filename command line option.  These
//                        files are processed after the default config file is 
//                        processed.
//                        The .CFG files should contain one command line option
//                        (including the leading "/" in column 1) per line.  
//                        Lines that do not start with  /,-,$, or = are ignored.  
//                      - Added '$' and '=' command line/.CFG file  options for 
//                        building lists of hex bytes to send to the tbolt.  
//                        The '=' list is sent when the program starts.  The '$'
//                        list is sent when a primary timing message is received
//                        (i.e. once each second).
//                            $10,3a,00,10,03   would request doppler/code phase 
//                                              data every second. 
//                            $10,3C,00,10,03   would request satellite status
//                                              and position data every second. 
//                        Note that the '$' and '=' command line options should 
//                        not be preceeded by a '/'.
//                      - If a file name does not have a .extension name or end
//                        in a '.',  the program tries to read a .LOG, .SCR,
//                        .LLA, .ADV, the .TIM files in that order
//
//                      - Added '/' keyboard command for setting command
//                        line options from the keyboard.  Note that some
//                        command line options cannot be changed from the 
//                        keyboard,  others may not be set properly.
//                        To set the '$' and '=' command line options,
//                        remember to backspace over the suggested leading '/'.
//
//                      - Added /tx command line option for showing the osc
//                        values with exponents (normally shows them with
//                        "ppb" and "ppt" which causes europeans to wander off
//                        in a daze of confusion and angst)
//
//                      - Added ability to actively stabilize the device 
//                        temperature. (/TT=degrees or TT command line option).
//                        Uses the serial port RTS and DTR lines.  RTS is the
//                        temperature controller enable (+12=off, -12=on)
//                        DTR is the heat (-12V) / cool (+12V) line.  Simple
//                        implementation:  Isolate tbolt in a box,  set control
//                        temperature below typical unit operating temp and
//                        above normal room temp,  when unit signals COOL turn
//                        on fan to move room air into the box.  You want the 
//                        fan to move enough air to cool the unit,  but not so
//                        much air that the temperature drops by more than 0.01C
//                        per second.  The indicator of too much airflow is a 
//                        temperature curve that spikes down around 0.1C several
//                        times per minute.  Too little airflow shows up as a
//                        curve that oscillates around 0.25C about set point over
//                        a couple of minutes.  Good airflow should show a 
//                        temperature curve stable to with 0.01C with a period of
//                        between 1 and 3 minutes.   Generally you do not want
//                        the fan to blow directly on the unit (mine is surrounded
//                        by foam).  You want to gently move air through the 
//                        box.  It can help to include a large thermal mass in 
//                        the box (I use a 2kg scale weight).  
//
//                      - The Thunderbolt firmware smooths the output of the
//                        temperature sensor with a filtering algorithm. This
//                        filtering can mask and prolong the occasional single
//                        point glitches that temperature sensor produces.  The
//                        default program action is to reverse the filtering
//                        that the firmware does.  This makes the sensor glitches
//                        much more obvious in the temperature plots and 
//                        minimizes their effect in the active temperature
//                        control mode.  The /TJ command line option disables
//                        the sensor un-filtering and the smoothed temperature
//                        data is used.
//
//                      - Added large time clock display - controlled by 
//                        the GZ command.  On small screens the clock will
//                        take the place of the sat info display.
//
//                      - Added analog clock (watch) display - controlled by 
//                        the GW command.  The watch display takes the place of
//                        the satellite az/el map on smaller screens.  Its 
//                        position is controlled with the GB and GM commands.  
//                        The watch display is not well suited to the DOS version.
//                      - You can specify a brand name for the analog watch
//                        with the /TB=name command.  The brand name can be two 
//                        lines long.  Separate the lines with a '/'  
//                        (e.g.  /tb=Patek/Philippe).  If no name is given, the 
//                        current day is used for the first line and the time zone
//                        name is used for the second lind.  To include blanks
//                        in the brand name, use an '_' character.   
//                        /TB with no first name uses the brand name to 'Trimble'.  
//                        To totally disable the brand display use /TB=_/_
//                        The brand display defaults to off for small screens.
//
//                      - Added /D# command line option for showing dates in 
//                        various calendars.
//
//                      - Added support for showing the date and time at
//                        local time zones. You can set the time zone from the
//                        command line with /t=#sssss/ddddd where # is the 
//                        (standard) time zone offset from GMT and sssss is 
//                        up to 5 characters of standard time zone ID and ddddd
//                        is the daylight savings time zone id.  
//                        Fractional time zone offsets would be specified 
//                        like "/t=9:30ACST".  NOTE THAT WESTERN HEMISPHERE
//                        TIME ZONES ARE NEGATIVE NUMBERS! (i.e. /t=-6CDT/CST)
//                        The time zone ID strings can be up to 5 characters
//                        long (default=LOCAL).  If not /ddddd daylight savings
//                        time zone ID is given,  the program does not do
//                        any daylight savings time conversions.
//                        If a standard time zone in use,  the time shows in 
//                        blue.  If a daylight savings time is in use, it shows
//                        in CYAN.  If no local time zone is in use, it shows
//                        in WHITE.
//                      - Time zone string can also be specified in the standard
//                        DOS time zone format like CST6CDT (note: western
//                        hemisphere time zone offsets are positive values in
//                        this format)
//                      - The default daylight savings time switching dates are 
//                        the US standard.  Or use /B=1 for USA, /B=2 for UK/Europe, 
//                        /B=3 for Australia or /B=4 for New Zealand.  /B=0 
//                        turns off daylight savings time.  If the rules change
//                        or you live in a backwater,  you can specify a custom
//                        time zone rule:
//                          /B=n1,start_dow,start_month,n2,end_dow,end_month,hour
//                          n1 = start DST on nth occurance of the day-of-week
//                               if n1 > 0,  count day-of-week from start of month
//                               if n1 < 0   count from end of month
//                          start_dow - start DST day-of-week (0=Sunday, 1=Monday, ... 6=Daturday)
//                          start_month - 1..12 = January..December
//                          n2 = end DST on nth occurance of the day-of-week
//                               if n2 > 0,  count day-of-week from start of month
//                               if n2 < 0   count from end of month
//                          end_dow - end DST day-of-week (0=sunday, 1=monday, ... 6=saturday)
//                          end_month - 1..12 = January..December
//                          hour - local time of switchover (default = 2)
//                        Example:  /B=-1,0,9,2,3,4,6 says to start daylight 
//                                  savings time on the last Sunday in September
//                                  and return to standard time on the second
//                                  Wednesday in April at 6:00 local time.
//                      - Time zones can also be set from the keyboard with 
//                        the TZ command.  
//                      - There are four special time zone names:
//                            GMST - Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time
//                            GAST - Greenwich Apparent Sidereal Time
//                            LMST - Local Mean Sidereal Time
//                            LAST - Local Apparent Sidereal Time
//                        Setting one of these time zones will display the
//                        current sidereal time. The receiver will be put 
//                        into UTC time mode.  Since the sidereal time is
//                        based upon UTC, NOT UT1, it may be off a second or so.
//
//                      - Added TS and /TS commands to set the system clock to
//                        the Thunderbolt time.  Windows sets the system clock 
//                        using the GPS/UTC time from the GPS receiver
//                        and Windows takes care of the system time zone 
//                        conversion.  DOS sets the time using the currently 
//                        set time zone time.  
//                      - From the command line you can use /TSD to set the 
//                        system time every day (at 04:05:06 local time)
//                        or you can use /TSH to set the system time hourly 
//                        (at xx:05:06).  /TSM will set the time every minute
//                        (at xx:xx:06).
//                      - Use /TSA to set the system time anytime the
//                        system time millisecond value is not 0.
//                        (which may be continuously on slower machines!).
//                        Note that small values of /TSA require very fast
//                        system to insure that the proceesing overhead is less
//                        than the /TSA value.  Things like zoomed screens, the analog watch,  and
//                        the signal level map take a long time to compute.
//                        Use /TSA=msecs to set the system time whenever the 
//                        system time millisecond value exceeds msecs.
//                        Whenever a system time set is pending a message is 
//                        shown over the time area.  The /TSA value should be 
//                        greater than the /TW value.  Otherwise the clock will
//                        be continuously reset since the clock error due to the
//                        forced sleeps() will be greater than the /TSA value.
//                      - Use /TSX=msecs to specify the milliseconds of delay
//                        that the receiver time message ENDs after the 1PPS 
//                        output signal (default = 45).  The Tbolt sends the
//                        timing message 20 milliseconds after the 1 PPS signal.
//                        The timing message takes about 25 milliseconds to send
//                        and get processed by Heather.
//                      - If the tbolt is in GPS time mode,  the unit is 
//                        temporarily set to UTC mode to set the system time
//                        unless the last character of the /TS command is a "G".
//                        The program waits for a lull in incoming messages
//                        and activity before setting the time. Note that older
//                        versions of the progam allowed the /ts command line 
//                        option to set degrees/minutes/seconds display mode.
//                        Now use /t".  The program now defaults to UTC 
//                        time (older vsersions defaulted to GPS time).  If the 
//                        receiver is using UTC time,  it does not have to
//                        change time bases and reinitialize the filters when 
//                        it sets the CPU clock from the receiver data.
//                      - added /TP and /TQ commands for displaying the time
//                        as seconds in the day or fraction of the day.
//
//                      - Added /NX=hh:mm:ss command line value for setting a
//                        program exit time. You can also set an exit date 
//                        with /NX=month/day/year.  You can also set the exit
//                        time/date with the keyboard TX command.  Once the
//                        exit time is reached,  the program quits.
//
//                      - Added /NA=hh:mm:ss command line value for setting 
//                        an alarm time. You can also set an alarm date 
//                        with /NA=month/day/year.  You can also set the alarm
//                        time/date with the keyboard TA command.  When the
//                        alarm time is reached,  the program sounds and the
//                        big clock flashes red.  The WINDOWS version looks for
//                        the file "c:\WINDOWS\Media\heather_alarm.wav"  If not
//                        found, it uses the windows "chord" sound.
//
//                      - The alarm clock remains enabled until it is manually
//                        disabled from the keyboard with the TA command.
//
//                      - Alarm and exit times should be specified in the local
//                        time zone.  Note that the time is matched exactly to
//                        the incoming TSIP message time.  If the time message
//                        is skipped or missed,  the event will not trigger.
//                        There is no range checking or validation of date or
//                        time values...  If only a date is given,  the event
//                        will trigger at 00:00:00 on that date.
//
//                      - If no ':' or '/' is seen in the alarm or exit time
//                        string, and the string ends in a s, m, h, or d 
//                        (for seconds, minutes, hours, days) then a countdown 
//                        "egg timer" will be started.  The event triggers 
//                        after the specifed time interval.  If the egg timer 
//                        value ends in an 'r', the timer automatically repeats.
//
//                      - If an alarm time or egg timer string ends in an 'o', 
//                        the alarm tone sounds once, otherwise it sounds every 
//                        second until a key is pressed.  The alarm .wav file 
//                        should normally be under 1 second long,  but if the
//                        ONCE option is specified, it can be any length.
//
//                      - Added an automatic screen dump option.  The syntax
//                        and behavior is the same as the alarm clock/egg timer
//                        commands.  Use /ND... from the command line or TD from
//                        the keyboard.  If the command contains the 'o' character
//                        the file TBDUMP.GIF is re-written each time a dump
//                        occurs.  Without the 'o' character,  the file 
//                        TByyyy-mm-dd-#.GIF is written (where #) is a sequence
//                        number.  Example:  to write the screen image to the
//                        file TBDUMP.GIF every 30 minutes use the command
//                        line option /ND=30mor or "TD 30mor" from the keyboard.
//                        Screen dump mode is indicated on the screen by a '!'
//                        or !! next to the time mode indicator on the first
//                        line of the screen
//
//                      - Added an automatic log dump option.  The syntax
//                        and behavior is the same as the alarm clock/egg timer
//                        commands.  Use /NL... from the command line or TL from
//                        the keyboard.  If the command contains the 'o' character
//                        the file TBLOG.LOG is re-written each time a dump
//                        occurs.  Without the 'o' character,  the file 
//                        TByyyy-mm-dd-#.LOG is written (where #) is a sequence
//                        number.  Example:  to write the log to the
//                        file TBLOG.LOG every 30 minutes use the command
//                        line option /NL=30mor or "TL 30mor" from the keyboard.
//                        Log dump mode is indicated on the screen by a '!'
//                        or !! next to the time mode indicator on the first
//                        line of the screen.   The data that is written to
//                        the log file is the data that is shown in the plot window.  
//                         
//
//                      - Added chiming (cuckoo) clock mode.  /th[=#] from the 
//                        command line or 'th' from the keyboard.  # is the 
//                        number of times per hour to sound the chime 
//                        (and must divide evenly into 60 - default is 4 - 
//                        i.e. at 00, 15, 30, and 45 minutes)
//
//                        If # is followed by 'h' (i.e. /TH=4H or TH4H from the
//                        keyboard),  it chimes out the hour count on the hour.
//                        Otherwise it sounds three times on the hour,  
//                        twice on the half hour,  otherwise once.  The WINDOWS 
//                        version looks for the file:
//                            c:\WINDOWS\Media\heather_chime.wav
//                        If not found, it uses the windows "notify" sound.
//                        The .wav file should be under 1 second long if you
//                        want to chime out the hour count.
//
//                        If # is followed by 's' (i.e. /TH=4S or TH4S from
//                        the keyboard),  the clock is a singing clock.  The
//                        file c:\WINDOWS\Media\heather_song##.wav is
//                        played at each event (where ## is the minute 
//                        number (usually 00,15,30, or 45). If a song file 
//                        does not exist,  the Windows beep is played.
//
//
// It's no longer called Beta!
//
// 3.10 - 19 APR 2012   - Added support for Nortel NTGS55A receivers.  They
//                        should be automatically recognized and enabled.  It
//                        may take a minute or so for the oscillator disciplining
//                        parameters to be updated.  You can specify the /nt
//                        command line option to do a more agressive Nortel
//                        recognition routine.  Or you can do /nt /nt to disable
//                        the Nortel check.  The Nortel receivers use
//                        alternate/undocumented commands to control the 
//                        oscillator disciplining (time constant,
//                        damping, gain, initial voltage).  The /NT command may
//                        also be useful for early versions of the Thunderbolt
//                        firmware that use the undocumented disciplining
//                        commands.  A series of red '*' chars is printed during
//                        the wakeup proceedure.  If the unit hangs while doing
//                        this, you will need to kill the program manually and try 
//                        again.
//
//                      - Added support for Resolution-T and Resolution SMT 
//                        timing receivers.  Many surplus Resolution SMT receivers
//                        are configured to do TEP (Motorola) format messages.
//                        You MUST first use the Trimblemon program to configure
//                        them for TSIP commands and 9600,8,N,1 serial protocol
//                        before Lady Heather can talk to them.  Remember to save
//                        the config into EEPROM.
//
//                        Resolution-T receivers are factory configured for 
//                        9600,8,O,1 serial protocol.  Lady Heather should 
//                        recognize this within 30 seconds,  or you can use 
//                        the /rt command line option,  or use Trimblemon to 
//                        reconfigure them for the Thunderbolt standard 
//                        9600,8,N,1 protocol.  Again, remember to save the
//                        configuration in EEPROM.  Note that it takes several
//                        seconds for a Resolution-T to recover from and update 
//                        values after changing the receiver filer settings
//                        (or probably anything that writes the EEPROM)
//
//                      - There is apparently an undocumented TSIP command for 
//                        reading and setting the allowable EFC DAC range.
//                        You can alter the low and high values with the 
//                        UNDOCUMENTED &L and &H keyboard commands.  These values
//                        might just be for reporting the allowable range to 
//                        the software or they might do something else!
//                        Caveat emptor if you use/change them!
//



//
//  This program requires the following operating system dependent routines:
//
//  init_hardware() - put screen in a high res graphics mode or open a 
//                    graphics window and open the com port (9600,8,N,1)
//
//  dot(x,y, color) - draw a colored dot
//
//  vidstr(row,col, color, string) - draw a colored text string on the screen
//       Note that row and col are in text (usually 8x16 cell) character coordinates
//
//  kill_screen() - close graphics screen or window
//
//  sendout(c)  - send 'c' to the serial port
//
//  SERIAL_DATA_AVAILABLE() - a routine or macro that returns true if 
//                            there is serial port data available
//
//  get_serial_char()  - get a character from the serial port
//
//  kill_com()    - close down serial port
//
//  SetDtrLine(state)
//  SetRtsLine(state)
//  SetBreak(state)
//
//  KBHIT() - a routine or macro that returns true if a keyboard key has
//            been pressed
//
//  GETCH() - a routine or macro that returns the keyboard character
//
//  refresh_page() - copy any virtual screen buffer to the screen
//                   or flip pages if doing screen buffering.  Can be
//                   a null routine if writing directly to the screen.
//
//  BEEP() - sound a beep if beep_on is set
//  alarm_clock() - sound an alarm tone
//  cuckoo_clock() - sound a clock chime tone
//
//  set_cpu_clock() - has OS dependent code for setting the system time
//
//  GetMsecs() - returns an double precision count of milliseconds (can
//               be since program started,  os boot, or any base time
//               reference (used to do pwm control of the heat/cool cycle
//               if doing precise temp control)
//
//  Also the show_mouse_info() routine will need to be updated to handle
//  the system mouse.  You need to get the current mouse coordinates into
//  variables mouse_x and mouse_y and the button state into this_button.
//
//  Also,  you can improve performance with operating system dependent
//  line drawing and area erasing functions.
//
// Note: stupid DOS linker does not allow initialized variables to be declared
//       in more than one file (even if defined as externs).  Therefore any
//       variables that are used in more than one file are initialized
//       in the routine set_defaults();
